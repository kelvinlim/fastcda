# fastcda

fastcda is a package for performing causal discovery analysis.

The primary driver of this project is to create a package that can be installed quickly with minimal friction, support multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS) and have fast execution and the ability to handle large datasets efficiently.  Consequently, the core causal search algorithms are written in C with the other "glue" components written in Python.
